       <h4 class="card-title text-center">ESPRESSO</h4>
       <p  class="text">Espresso is not necessarily a type of coffee, but a way to make coffee. The difference is the amount of water used to make espressos versus regularly brewed coffee.Because they are made with a shot of water instead of a liter of water per cup of ground coffee, espressos are basically highly concentrated coffee. Because of this, you can expect espressos to have a more heightened array of flavors compared to your regular cup of coffee.Like with other variations of coffee, there are health benefits when drinking a cup or two a day, and with the added benefit of having little to no calories. Espressos are packed with antioxidants, providing ample protection against infections. Drinking espressos every day.</p>

Anything from sweet to herbal can be added to them, and latte art can be added to complete the drink. Lattes are similar to cappuccinos because they are also made with espresso, steamed milk, and milk foam.The ratio of ingredients is what separates the two drinks; however: while cappuccinos have equal ratios, lattes have more steamed milk. The ingredients in lattes are also mixed together instead of being layered, like what can be found in cappuccinos. Compared to cappuccinos and the many other espresso-based drinks, lattes are not very strong in taste.This especially becomes the case when shots of flavors.</p>

       <p  class="text">Frappuccinos are often compared to milkshakes, which is understandable. A Frappuccino is basically just an iced cappuccino that was blended into a milkshake.Thus, they are creamy, smooth, and light, just like milkshakes. Because it is still coffee, however, rest assured that you will still get the desired caffeine fix.The word. “Frappuccino’*. is trademarked by Starbucks, meaning it cannot be used by other companies.In spite of this, companies and the general public have chosen to call all drinks like the Frappuccino. “frappe.” which is originally the name of a setting on blenders. The two words are often used in place of the other, and though they are not technically the same thing, they can be made to appear the same.On the flip side, frappes are blended ice drinks served with flavored syrups and whipped cream at the top. It is literally just a general name for a blended, iced drink. Either way. Both types of drinks are often topped with desired flavored syrups and whipped cream.You can typically find caramel or mocha Frappuccinos or frappes available at any shop that sells coffee. Much like the other cold types of coffee, you can expect your Frappuccino or frappe to be refreshingly sweet, with icy aftertastes of whipped cream if you added it.</p>
